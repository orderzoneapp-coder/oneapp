# ORDER Q vNext Architecture

Version: 0.2.0  
Reviewed: 2026-08-13

## 1. Scope

ORDER Q vNext is an independent pilot under `/orderq/`. Existing `orderops/` and root `orderops_list.html` remain unchanged.

Phase 3 adds `/orderq/parser.html`. SmartParser never writes ORDER / ORDER_ITEM directly: raw text and parse decisions are stored separately, then confirmed actions call the shared Order Intake Engine.

The vNext data path is:

`Input / future SmartParser → Order Intake → IndexedDB → Sync Engine → Cloud Adapter → Google Apps Script / purpose sheets`

Later, only the Cloud Adapter boundary is intended to change to `Server API → PostgreSQL`; the Order Intake and local repository contracts remain stable.

## 2. Ownership and source of truth

- Current phase: IndexedDB `oneapp-orderq-vnext` is the local working database.
- SmartParser immutable input: `rawInputs`; message decisions and confirmed values: `parseResults`.
- Duplicate boundary: unique `sourceMessageKey` indexes on `parseResults` and `orders`.
- Google Sheet cloud is a central synchronization and recovery layer, not an ERP ledger.
- Future server phase: server DB becomes primary; IndexedDB becomes cache/offline storage.
- Order business identity is `orderId`; an order line is `orderItemId`; customer identity is `customerId`.
- Order changes are revisioned. Delete-by-overwrite is prohibited for business cancellation/history.

## 3. Cloud contract

Schema: `ONEAPP_ORDERQ_SYNC_V1`

POST actions:

- `orderq_sync_push`
- `orderq_sync_pull`
- `orderq_order_head`

The client uses the existing shared cloud URL contract `oneapp_cloud_sync_url_v1` with legacy fallback `merchCloudUrl_v870`.

Purpose sheets are created on first sync and share one central workbook:

- `ORDER`
- `ORDER_ITEM`
- `ORDER_EVENT`
- `CUSTOMER_MASTER`
- `CUSTOMER_ALIAS_MAPPING`
- `PRODUCT_MAPPING`
- `UNIT_MAPPING`
- `MAPPING_EVENT`
- `SYNC_META`

Do not create one sheet per customer. Customer-specific lookup is performed with `customerId` fields inside common tables.

## 4. Incremental synchronization

Every local change enters IndexedDB `syncQueue` with a unique `queueId`.

`SYNC_META` is an append-only cloud change index using a monotonically increasing `sequence`. Each browser stores its last applied cursor and pulls only later sequences.

A repeated `queueId` is idempotent and must not create a duplicate cloud write.

A local cloud failure does not discard the order. The queue remains pending and can be retried.

Phase 1 data is compatible: on the first phase 2 sync, Customer/Alias/Event reference records not already represented in the queue are queued once.

## 5. Order concurrency

Order mutation uses optimistic locking:

- create: `revision=1`, `baseRevision=0`
- update/cancel: new `revision`, with the previously loaded revision in `baseRevision`
- cloud accepts the write only when the current server revision equals `baseRevision`

When two devices open the same revision, the first accepted cloud save wins. The second stale save is rejected as a conflict.

Policy:

- no automatic overwrite;
- no automatic merge;
- preserve the user's current form contents;
- show the cloud revision conflict;
- administrator applies/reads the cloud latest order and then re-enters or confirms the intended change.

When cloud is unavailable, local-first work is permitted. A later synchronization can therefore surface a conflict; it must never silently choose one side.

## 6. Data separation

The following are separate logical datasets even when linked by IDs:

- customer master;
- customer alias/mapping dictionary;
- product/unit mapping dictionaries;
- mapping events;
- order/order-item/order-event transactions;
- future ERP customer sales ledger.

The future ERP sales ledger is the authoritative transaction ledger. Mapping dictionaries are recognition memory and must not be treated as ledger facts.

## 7. Deployment boundary

GitHub Pages deploys `/orderq/` from repository `main` automatically.

The Google Apps Script backend is a separate deployment boundary. A repository merge of `code.gs` / `orderq-cloud.gs` does not by itself prove that the live Apps Script Web App contains those versions. Phase 2 production acceptance therefore requires the bound Apps Script project to deploy both files and a two-device operational test.
